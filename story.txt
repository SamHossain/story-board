There once was a man named Mason. He was a stone mason from Mason City Iowa.
  Every day Mason would get up go for a nice morning walk in the sun light and then he would eat two eggs and two pieces of toast. Then mason would get ready and leave for work, he would bike to his job site and based on the job he had to do, he would build or help design. Mason was sucha good stone mason, everyone wanted him on their team. He was nice, always got his work done and knew what he was doing. Working with Mason, made everyone else look better. Mason did not notice this he would keep to himself mostly at work, he would communicate with the other workers when he had to, but other than that he would think. Mason would think about the people that hired him and the people that he worked with and he would watch them. Thats how he would learn so much, from watching all the people around him. Even though Mason was so quiet at work, he loved his job. But one day at work something happened that deviated from his daily routine.
